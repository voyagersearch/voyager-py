#Zip Files

Compress input files into a single zip file.

###Usage Tips
  - The input results must be file types and cannot include ArcGIS geodatabase datasets such as feature classes. However, a file geodatabase (.gdb) can be zipped.
  - When zipping Shapefiles, all supporting files such as .shp, .dbf, .shx, etc., are zipped.
  - When zipping Smart Data Compression files, all supporting files such as .sdc, .sdi, etc., are zipped.
  - By default, a file's directory structure is maintained in the output zip file.
